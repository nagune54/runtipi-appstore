## Features

* Read archives directly from your web browser: the server reads from within compressed files using temporary folders.

* Read your archives in dedicated reader software using the built-in OPDS Catalog (now with PSE support!)

* Two different user interfaces : compact archive list with thumbnails-on-hover, or thumbnail view.

* Localized interface with English, Chinese, and more to come.  

* Choose from 5 preinstalled responsive library styles, or add your own with CSS.  

* Full Tag support with Namespaces: Add your own or import them from other sources using Plugins.
